# RE-to-NFA
This project is to parse the regular expression to NFA(non-determinism finite automaton), as the two are equivalent. 

# Overveiw of Model
The basic idea is parse the regular expressiont to an abstract syntax tree. And then using the AST(abstract syntax tree) to generate NFA. Finally, computing the NFA layout, and then draw the NFA.
